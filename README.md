Consolidating RESTFUL calls from the CoinGecko API into a React application. I'll be using v3 of the API (the most recent version at the time of starting this project).

### Sources

- [(React Documentation)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html): The website relies on React as its primary JavaScript library for constructing the user interface. React is a widely adopted choice for crafting dynamic and engaging web applications.

- [(CSS)](https://web.dev/learn/css/): CSS was responsible for controlling the presentation and layout of web pages as well as implementation of responsiveness and media queries.

- [(API)]([https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#)): The static API data is defined within the client-side codebase, specifically in the data.js file. This data is bundled with the client-side JavaScript code when the application is built and deployed. It's used by the client-side React components to populate and render product listings on the user interface.
